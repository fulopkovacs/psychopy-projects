- **The experimental design of the _word recognition_ experiment has changed!**
  - _before:_ the words were presented for 200 ms
  - _after:_ the words are visible until the participant presses the "r" or
    "n" key
- The incorrect term _"fake word"_ has been replaced with the _"non-word"_ everywhere in the project.
